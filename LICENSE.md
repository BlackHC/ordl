# Open Research and Derivatives License (ORDL) v1.0

## 1. Preamble
The Open Research and Derivatives License (ORDL) ensures that research and its derivatives remain open and freely accessible. By maintaining transparency and promoting collaboration, this license facilitates the continued sharing of knowledge and advances in research.

## 2. Definitions
- **Original Work**: The initial research paper, code, data, methodologies, and any associated materials covered by this license.
- **Derivative Work**: Any work based upon the Original Work, including new research, analysis, insights, supplementary data, software implementations, or any other form of modification or extension.
- **Licensee**: Any individual or entity that uses, modifies, or distributes the Original Work or Derivative Works.
- **Licensor**: The individual or entity that holds the copyright to the Original Work and grants this license.
- **Publication**: Making the work available to the public through any medium, including but not limited to online repositories, journals, preprint servers, and public presentations, with a minimum level of accessibility that allows for the work to be freely accessed, read, and downloaded by the general public.

## 3. Grant of License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Original Work and create and distribute Derivative Works, provided that:

1. Any Derivative Work must be licensed under the same ORDL terms.
2. Redistribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works must include this License and retain all copyright and license notices.
3. Any subsequent research based on the Original Work must be published or made available under the ORDL or a similar open license. Acceptable platforms include recognized open-access repositories, institutional repositories, or open-access journals that comply with the principles of open sharing. See §4.3 for more details.

## 4. Detailed Conditions
1. **Attribution**: The Licensee must attribute the Original Work in the manner specified by the Licensor, including citation guidelines, if provided. This attribution requirement applies to both the Original Work and any Derivative Works unless the Licensor explicitly waives this right.

2. **Integrity**: The Licensee must respect the integrity of the Original Work and any Derivative Works. Any distortion, modification, or mutilation of the work that could harm the reputation or honor of the original author or creator is prohibited. If the Licensee makes any changes to the Original Work or a Derivative Work, they must clearly indicate and describe the modifications.

3. **Publication Requirement**: Any research or Derivative Work based on, builds upon, incorporates, reuses, or is otherwise derived from the Original Work must be published or made available under the ORDL or a similar open license. This requirement applies regardless of the medium of dissemination, including journals, conferences, or online platforms. The purpose is to maintain the continued openness and availability of the research.

### 4.3.1 Embargo Periods
The Licensor may impose a temporary embargo period on the publication of the Original Work when required by funders, institutions, or publishers, such as academic journals or conference proceedings. The embargo period shall not exceed 12 months, unless a longer period of up to 24 months is expressly required by the funder, institution, or publisher, and the Licensor provides a written justification for the extended embargo duration.

1. During the embargo period, the Licensee may use and create Derivative Works but may not publish or publicly distribute them until the embargo has expired. Licensees may share Derivative Works with other collaborators who are bound by the same embargo terms, provided that these Derivative Works are not published or publicly distributed until the embargo has expired.

2. If the Original Work is subject to an embargo period, the Licensor shall notify Licensees of the embargo terms, including the duration of the embargo, and work with them to ensure compliance with funders, institutional, or publisher requirements. Licensees shall coordinate with the Licensor to determine appropriate publication and distribution timelines for Derivative Works.

3. Embargo periods are intended to be temporary and shall not be used to indefinitely restrict access to the Original Work or Derivative Works. Once the embargo period has expired, the Licensor shall promptly make the Original Work available under the terms of this License.

4. *Example Scenario*: If a research paper is submitted to a journal with a required embargo period, the Licensee may use and develop Derivative Works during this period but must wait until the embargo expires to publish or distribute them in turn.

### 4.3.2 Software and Product Licensing
Software, tools, or products developed based on the Original Work or Derivative Works must comply with one of the following:

1. The software, tool, or product must be published and shared under a permissive open-source license that allows for free use, modification, and distribution, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser General Public License (LGPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), MIT License, or Apache License 2.0. The specific open-source license used may be chosen by the Licensee but must be compatible with the general principles of open sharing and collaboration promoted by the ORDL.

2. If the software, tool, or product is not published under such a permissive open-source license, the Licensee must publish a research work that documents the key contributions, results, and methodologies of the software, tool, or product in a way that enables reproducibility and dissemination of the research contributions. This research work must be licensed under the ORDL or a similarly permissive license that ensures open access to the research findings.

For software, tools, or products that are published under an open-source license, as described in §4.3.2.1, no further research work is required to be published but is recommended. The dual licensing approach described in §4.3.2.2 allows for the creation of closed-source derivative works or products, provided that the underlying research contributions are made available through an openly licensed research work. However, licensees are encouraged to make their software, tools, or products available under open-source licenses whenever possible, in the spirit of promoting open collaboration and enabling reproducibility.

### 4.3.3 Commercial Use Restrictions
Notwithstanding the terms of the ORDL as applied to the Original Work and Derivative Works, software, tools, or products developed as part of the research may be subject to separate licensing terms that restrict commercial use. However, any such restrictions must not prevent or hinder the open sharing, collaboration, or reproducibility of the underlying research.

If the Licensor chooses to apply commercial use restrictions to software artifacts, they shall:

1. Provide clear notice of these restrictions alongside the software;
2. Ensure that the software is available under an open-source license for non-commercial use;
3. Publish the key contributions, results, and methodologies of the software, tool, or product in an openly licensed research work, as described in §4.3.2.2, to enable open collaboration and reproducibility.

Dual licensing of software artifacts is permitted, allowing the Licensor to offer the software under both a proprietary license that allows for commercial use and a non-commercial open-source license, provided that the conditions above are met.

### 4.3.4. National Security and Public Safety Exception
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this License, the Licensor may, at their discretion or upon the request of a government agency, withhold the publication or distribution of the Original Work, Derivative Works, or any associated research works, software, tools, or products, if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to pose a significant threat to national security or public safety as mandated by law.

In invoking this exception, the Licensor shall:

1. Notify the Licensee(s) that the exception is being invoked, to the extent permitted by law and national security considerations, within 30 days of the decision to withhold publication or distribution;
2. Provide a justification for invoking the exception, to the extent permitted by law and national security considerations, within 60 days of the decision to withhold publication or distribution; and
3. Work with the relevant government agency(ies) to determine the scope and duration of the restrictions on publication or distribution, which shall be limited to the minimum necessary to address the identified threat to national security or public safety.
4. Once the threat to national security or public safety has abated, as determined by the Licensor in consultation with the relevant government agency(ies), the Licensor shall promptly lift any restrictions on publication or distribution and notify the Licensee(s) accordingly, no later than 30 days after the determination that the threat has abated.
5. The Licensor shall not invoke this exception unnecessarily or in a manner that unduly restricts the open dissemination of research, and shall make every effort to minimize the scope and duration of any restrictions imposed pursuant to this exception.

## 5. Moral Rights
1. **Attribution**: As detailed in §4.1.
2. **Integrity**: As detailed in §4.2.
3. **Right of Disclosure and Withdrawal**: By licensing the Original Work under the ORDL, the Licensor irrevocably waives their right of disclosure and withdrawal for the purpose of allowing the creation and distribution of Derivative Works under the terms of this License, except as provided in §4.3.4 (National Security and Public Safety Exception). This ensures that any Derivative Work remains available and open under the same licensing terms, preventing retraction or restriction of access, unless the exception in §4.3.4 applies.
4. **Pseudonymity**: The Licensor retains the right to have the Original Work attributed to them under a pseudonym or to remain anonymous. The Licensee must respect this right in both the Original Work and any Derivative Works.

## 6. Termination and Consequences
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of this License. Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease using, reproducing, modifying, and distributing the Original Work and any Derivative Works. The Licensee must also remove any infringing content from all platforms and media under their control.

In the event of a breach, the Licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action against the Licensee to enforce the terms of this License and seek appropriate remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief and monetary damages.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Original Work or the use or other dealings in the Original Work.

## 8. Versioning
The Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of the ORDL from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Derivative Works may use any version of the ORDL that has been published, but once a version has been chosen, the Derivative Work must continue to use that version or a later version if one is available.

## 9. Acceptance
By exercising any rights to the Original Work provided here, the Licensee accepts and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this ORDL. If the Licensee does not agree to these terms, they may not use, reproduce, modify, or distribute the Original Work.

## 10. Intellectual Property Disclaimer
This License does not grant any rights to trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or any other intellectual property rights beyond the copyright in the Original Work and Derivative Works as specified in §3 (Grant of License).

## 11. Severability
If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties.

## 12. Applying the License to Research Papers and Publications

When applying the ORDL to research papers, preprints, or other publications, the Licensor shall include a clear and prominent notice stating that the work is licensed under the ORDL. The recommended placement for this notice is on the first page of the publication, such as:

- In the header or footer of the first page
- Near the title or author information
- After the abstract or before introduction section

For submissions to online repositories or preprint servers, such as arXiv, the license notice should be included in the metadata or front matter of the submission, as appropriate for the platform.

### 12.1 License Notice Content
The license notice should include the following information:

1. A statement that the work is licensed under the Open Research and Derivatives License (ORDL) v1.0.
2. A reference to the full text of the license, either by providing a URL to the license or by including the full license text as an appendix to the publication.

Example license notice:

> This work is licensed under the Open Research and Derivatives License (ORDL) v1.0.
> For full terms and conditions, see: [URL to the full license text]

### 12.2 Inclusion of Full License Text
In addition to the license notice, the Licensor may choose to include the full text of the ORDL as an appendix or supplementary material to the publication. This is particularly helpful when submitting to platforms that do not provide a convenient way to link to external license terms.

When including the full license text, it should be clearly labeled as the "Open Research and Derivatives License (ORDL) v1.0" and should not be modified or altered in any way.

By following these guidelines, Licensors can ensure that their publications are properly licensed under the ORDL and that the license terms are clearly communicated to readers and potential users of the work.
